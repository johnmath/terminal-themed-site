# Hi 👋

I am a fifth-year Computer Science PhD student at Northeastern University, advised by [Jonathan Ullman](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jullman/) and [Alina Oprea](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/alina/). Prior to my PhD, I completed my B.S. in Pure Math at Florida State University, where I wrote my honors thesis under the guidance of [Alec Kercheval](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~kercheva/) and [Nathan Crock](https://www.sc.fsu.edu/people?uid=ndc08)

My research primarily focuses on trustworthy machine learning, with an emphasis on empirically measuring privacy and security risks of deep learning models 🔒. More broadly, I am interested in topics such as memorization, differential privacy, adversarial machine learning, and AI safety.

I have held multiple industry research positions, most recently as a Student Researcher at [Google](https://research.google/) where I worked on machine unlearning and as an Applied Research Intern on [LinkedIn's](https://about.linkedin.com/) Data Privacy team where I worked on measuring leakage from statistical queries and LLMs. I have also held roles in software engineering and data science at [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/) and [NewSci Labs](https://labs.newsci.ai/), respectively.

# Hi there

I am a fourth-year Computer Science PhD Student at **Northeastern University**, where I am advised by [Jonathan Ullman](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jullman/) and [Alina Oprea](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/alina/). I completed my B.S. in Pure Mathematics at **Florida State University** and conducted my undergraduate honors thesis under the guidance of [Alec Kercheval](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~kercheva/) and [Nathan Crock](https://www.sc.fsu.edu/people?uid=ndc08).

## Research Interests

My primary research interest is **privacy in deep learning**. More broadly, I am interested in both theoretical computer science and applied machine learning, including topics such as:

- Differential privacy
- Adversarial machine learning  
- Trustworthiness of machine learning algorithms
- Property inference attacks
- Privacy-preserving machine learning

## Industry Experience

I have held industry positions in both software engineering and data science:

- **[Google](https://about.google/)** - Student Researcher (Fall 2024)  
  *Exploring open problems in machine unlearning* 🔒

- **[LinkedIn](https://about.linkedin.com/)** - Applied Research Intern (Summers 2023 & 2024)  
  *Data Privacy team - empirically measuring privacy leakage in analytics and LLMs*

- **[Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/)** - Software Engineer

- **[NewSci Labs](https://labs.newsci.ai/)** - Data Scientist

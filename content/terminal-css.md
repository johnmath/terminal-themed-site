## About Terminal.css

The color schemes are powered by [**terminal.css**](https://panr.github.io/terminal-css/), which provides a collection of modern, accessible color schemes for terminal-style interfaces.

## Customization

The themes maintain consistency across:

All colors automatically adapt when switching themes to ensure optimal contrast and readability.
